# ToileDeFond

ToileDeFond is a backend modularity framework for web (mostly) or desktop applications, created and maintained by [Maxime SÃ©guin](http://www.maximeseguin.com). The root idea was to build a CMS that gets out of your way by letting the developpers work as if there was no CMS while encouraging them to build small reusable modules.

## Most notable features
*[ASP.NET MVC](http://www.asp.net/mvc) Modularity (with the help of [MEF](http://mef.codeplex.com/))
