# ToileDeFond

ToileDeFond is a backend modularity framework for web (mostly) or desktop applications, created and maintained by [Maxime SÃ©guin](http://www.maximeseguin.com). The root idea was to build a CMS that gets out of your way by letting the developpers work as if there was no CMS while encouraging them to build small reusable modules.

###Important: This is mostly a pet project, not intended to be used in production. Use at your own risk!

## Most notable features
* [ASP.NET MVC](http://www.asp.net/mvc) Modularity (with the help of [MEF](http://mef.codeplex.com/))
* Content Management (with the help of RavenDB... could be implemented with another persistence tool)
  * Frontend scaffolding (ASP.NET MVC Based)
* Simple Membership (rewriten to work with RavenDB - only a proof of concept at this time)
